		<h3> Concept Note </h3>

		<p>Taking notes during a user research call is painful.

			After speaking with our users, we discovered that everyone takes notes during calls, but everyone does it
			differently. All methods require returning to the call recording and processing it to highlight key
			moments.<br> <br>

			We designed a live note-taker and a call recorder for Zoom to eliminate the need to return to the recording
			to take notes. Users can use the recorder to take live notes linked to the transcript while focusing on the
			interview.</p>

	<div class="container-home padding-blog" style="align-items: left; margin: -2px 0 0 0;">
		<p>During our conversations with researchers, designers, marketers, and company CXOs we realized they took
			unstructured and structured notes. But all of them faced challenges while matching/collating the notes with
			interview transcript.</p>

		<h3>Part -I : Unstructured Note taking</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>âœ³ï¸Ž Researchers usually complain about the research process taking too long.</li>
			<li>âœ³ï¸Ž Revisiting an interview after it's done is one of the most painful parts of the process.
			</li>
			<li>âœ³ï¸Ž It's similar to conducting the interview again, but with the additional effort of tagging and
				attaching notes to the transcript taken during the conversation.
			</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>Prototype testing our hypotheses</h3>
		<p>We designed and usability tested a prototype that the users could interact with while we conducted a mock
			interview (interviewception). <br> <br> Giving them a prototype to interact with gave us insights into the
			actions they can and can't perform during an interview. We made the prototype on Protopie to make it work
			like the dev version to get accurate usability data.</p>
		<br>

		<br>

		<h3>Final Designs</h3>
		<p>Based on the findings, we made design changes to make it more useful during a call</p>

		<br>

		<div class="img-container"><img src="./images-loop-note/updated-note.png" class="img-blog"></div>

		<ul>
			<li>âœ³ï¸Ž Removed the emojis as they could not be interacted with during the call, and added a bookmark feature
				which could be accessed using the// shortcut. This also reduces the number of decisions a person makes
				during the call</li>
			<li>âœ³ï¸Ž People didn't expect the note-taking space to look like a chat, so we changed it into a more open
				space that makes the experience similar to a document.</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>What we learned</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>âœ³ï¸Ž We assumed people would engage with the emojis the most, but those were the least used during a call.
				This pointed towards the fact that they wanted the note-taking doc to be in the backend, not front-end,
				during a call.</li>
			<li>âœ³ï¸Ž Familiarity with the interface was the most important factor in getting a hang of the screen. This
				pointed towards the fact that when people wanted an experience to a Google or Notion doc.</li>
		</ul>

		<p>To add structure to user calls, we ran another experiment in which we introduced a Question Script to the
			live notetaking experience.</p>

		<h3>Part -II : Structured Note taking</h3>
		<p>We observed researchers were using a template to take notes during research calls. This helped them structure
			the notes and make sense of it with the transcript later on. But, there were a few problems with this
			approach</p>

		<ul>
			<li>âœ³ï¸Ž There was no way to make sense of data according to the note taking template</li>
			<li>âœ³ï¸Ž It was still difficult to get answers for questions or organize data in sections</li>
		</ul>

		<h4>Here are some examples of the templates used â¬‡ <br><br>
			Question and section wise note taking</h4>

		<br>

		<h3>Usability Testing</h3>
		<p>We iterated on top of previous designs and added sections to the note-taking view and tested with the users.
			Since an interactive design was not possible, we used notion toggle lists to test the concept before
			creating a working prototype in Protopie. Our assumptions before testing were</p>

		<ul>
			<li>âœ³ï¸Ž There was no way to make sense of data according to the note taking template</li>
			<li>âœ³ï¸Ž It was still difficult to get answers for questions or organize data in sections</li>
		</ul>

		<p>Based on these assumptions we iterated a few designs.</p>

		<br>

		<div class="img-container"><img src="./images-loop-note/iteration-1.png" class="img-blog">
		</div>

		<br>

		<div class="img-container"><img src="./images-loop-note/iteration-2.png" class="img-blog"></div>

		<br>

		<div class="img-container"><img src="./images-loop-note/iteration-3.png" class="img-blog"></div>

		<br>

		<h3>Final Design</h3>
		<p>Based on usability testing, we decided to remove the navigation from the question script as users didn't face
			issues with traversing the script. Since they moved progressively between questions, there was no need for a
			persistent list.</p>

		<br>

		<div class="img-container"><img src="./images-loop-note/final-design.png" class="img-blog"></div>

		<br>

		<h3>What I learned</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Users liked the idea of unstructured notes since it gave a way to take notes that didn't fit in any
				question</li>
			<li>Users needed simple ways to capture their thoughts without having to remember a lot of shortcuts</li>
		</ul>
