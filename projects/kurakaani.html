  <!-- Quick Summary -->
  <div class="container-home padding-blog" style="background: var(--accent-color);margin: -2px 0px -2px 0px">
    <h3 style="margin:0px;">Quick Summary</h3>
    <p>The Atomic Design principle uses the concept of atoms and molecules to set up a Design Language System. Having
      worked on maintaining and creating design systems, I created one for Nimbuzz Kurakaani, Nepal's Super App, as a
      part of their application redesign.</p>

      and when I was actually idle" — Shubham, 26 · Manager at an MNC
    </blockquote>

    <h3 style="margin:0 0 12px 0;">Project Description</h3>
    <p>Nimbuzz Kurakaani is Nepal's digital platform that houses multiple services like shopping, chat, quizzing, money
      transfer & much more in one app. To cater to the growing user base, the application's interface and experience
      needed an overhaul. <br><br> I was commissioned as a UI Designer to Redesign the app by creating a component-based
      system. The features in the application attract a relatively younger audience, usually young adults and people in
      their 20s. Therefore, all the decisions made during the redesign have been made keeping in mind the target
      audience.
    </p>
    <h3>Goals of the redesign</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Update the design language to have a modern and cheerful vibe</li>
      <li>Create a system that is scalable and easy to maintain</li>
      <li>Inculcate various platform guidelines to improve overall designs</li>
    </ul>

    <h3 style="margin:0px;">My Approach</h3>
    <p>Having worked on multiple projects where I've used a component library, I started with an Atomic Design approach
      to creating a component library.</p>

    <h3>Outcome of the project</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>With the creation of a design library, the time to design flows and screens reduced by ~60%</li>
      <li>The hand-off process got easier as the components were defined in one place and developers could pick the
        specs from there.</li>
      <li>The flows in the application were more refined and clear compared to the earlier version. This meant easy
        communication across teams.</li>
    </ul>
